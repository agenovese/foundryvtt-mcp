If you choose a surface, the trigger\u2019s sensor can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.

Triggers placed on a surface, are typically set off by touching or standing on them, removing another object covering the trigger, approaching within a certain distance of the trigger, or manipulating the object on which the trigger is placed. Triggers placed within an object are most commonly set off by opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing and looking at the trigger for a set length of time. Once a trigger is set off, its effect activates then immediately ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the effect activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, to be set off only by netherants or kanasi), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t set off the trigger, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you place the trigger, choose between an explosive trigger and a power trigger.\nExplosive Trigger. When set off, the trigger erupts with elemental energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trigger. The sphere spreads around corners.

A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trigger), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPower Trigger. You can store a power of rank 3 or lower in the trigger by activating it as part of using this power. When you do so, you expend the appropriate tech slot or talent points in addition to the cost of using this power. The power must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when used in this way. When the trigger is set off, the stored power is activated. If the power has a target, it targets the creature that set off the trigger. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.
