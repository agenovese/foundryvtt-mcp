The trigger can take the form of a semi-translucent mark (in a design of your choice) or a tiny micro-device. It is placed either upon a surface (such as a desk, panel, or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a box, case, or cabinet) to conceal the trigger. If you choose a surface, the trigger\u2019s sensor can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you activated this power, the trigger is nullified, and the effect automatically ends.\nThe trigger is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your esper power save DC to be found.\nYou decide what sets off the trigger when you activate this power. Triggers placed on a surface, are typically set off by touching or standing on them, removing another object covering the trigger, approaching within a certain distance of the trigger, or manipulating the object on which the trigger is placed. Triggers placed within an object are most commonly set off by opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing and looking at the trigger for a set length of time. Once a trigger is set off, its effect activates then immediately ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the effect activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, to be set off only by netherants or kanasi), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t set off the trigger, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you activate this power, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once set off, the trigger glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the effect ends. Each creature in the sphere when the trigger activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nDeath.

Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\u2019t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, powers, or other similar effects.\nInsanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\u2019t take actions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speaks only in gibberish.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save.

You cannot teleport between two moving vehicles unless their motion is caused by the planet\u2019s gravity (for example, you can\u2019t teleport between two ships operating on their own thrusters, but you can teleport to a ship in nearby orbit around the planet). Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.\nFamiliarity\tMishap\tSimilar Area\tOff Target\tOn Target\nVery familiar\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\u2014\t01\u2013100\nAssociated object\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\u2014\t01\u2013100\nStudied carefully\t01\t02-03\t04-05\t06-100\nSeen casually\t01-03\t04-08\t09-15\t16-100\nViewed once\t01-05\t06-10\t11-25\t26-100\nDescription\t01-05\t06-15\t16-30\t31-100\nFalse destination\t01-25\t26-100\t\u2014\t\u2014\n\nFamiliarity. \u201cVery familiar\u201d means a place you\u2019ve been to very often and where you feel at home, such as your favorite nightclub or the place where you grew up. \u201cAssociated object\u201d means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a datapad from an old bunker, a SIM recording from your last concert, or the leather jacket you bought from a shop.\n\u201cStudied carefully\u201d is a place you have visited more than once for a prolonged period, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you activate the power. \u201cSeen casually\u201d is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\u2019t very familiar. \u201cViewed once\u201d is a place you have seen once, possibly from an image or video. \u201cDescription\u201d is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\u2019s description, or perhaps spot on a map or chart.\n\u201cFalse destination\u201d is a place that doesn\u2019t exist. Perhaps you\u2019re working off of false data, or you\u2019re attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 \u00d7 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to an elevated city and wound up 18 miles somewhere out in the sky, you could be in a lot of trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your local starbase or space dock, for example, you might wind up in another space station or in an construction yard that holds similar ships and machinery. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the power has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere in the galaxy.\nMishap. A miscalculation causes the signature of all targets within the fold to become scrambled. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\nAt Higher Ranks. When you use this power at rank 8, you gain a +15 bonus to your d100 roll. In addition, you can teleport to other planets within the same star system in which your familiarity is \u201cSeen casually\u201d or better. At rank 9, you gain a +25 bonus to your roll and can teleport anywhere in the galaxy that you\u2019ve been to at least once.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you use this power at rank 8, you gain a +15 bonus to your d100 roll.
