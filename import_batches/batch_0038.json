The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the power\u2019s effect; if it succeeds, it is immune to this power if you use it again. While affected by this power, the creature doesn\u2019t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn\u2019t age. Clairsentient powers can\u2019t locate or perceive the target.\nWhen you activate the power, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\nForce Tomb. The target is entombed far beneath the nearest planetary surface in a sphere of cosmic force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use powers such as intangible form to get into or out of it.\nDimensional Prison. The target is transported into an extradimensional space that is warded against teleportation and similar powers. The prison can be a labyrinth, a brig, a building, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nPattern Containment. The target is absorbed into a mundane trinket no larger than 2 inches on any side. The object must be solid, containing no circuitry or moving parts, such as a piece of jewelry, a card, gemstone, bullet casing, or a marble. The object can\u2019t be damaged or broken while the power remains in effect.\nSorium Bind. A cylinder made of hardened metallic sorium bands wrap around the creature from top to bottom. The target is restrained until the effect ends, and it can\u2019t move or be moved by any means until then.\nEnding the Effect. During the activation of this power, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the effect to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.\nThe conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or background but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "Esper Genesis Core Manual", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "minute", "value": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "", "units": "spec"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "30", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 9, "school": "evo", "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": [], "activities": {}, "identifier": "cosmic-prison", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}, {"name": "Cosmic Weave", "type": "spell", "img": "icons/magic/fire/projectile-fireball-smoke-strong-orange.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>Cosmic weave is the ultimate form of shaping the universe. By activating this power, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this power is to duplicate any other power of rank 8 or lower. You don\u2019t need to meet any requirements in that power. It simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nYou create one object of up to 250,000 cu in value that isn\u2019t a forge enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\nYou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the major remedy power.\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other supernatural effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a netherant\u2019s life drain attack.\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a cosmic weave power could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your desires to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the request, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you formulated your desire. For example, stating that you desire the death of an enemy might propel you forward in time to a period when that enemy is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, stating that you want a unique weapon or ship might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.\nThe stress of activating this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you use a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per rank of that power. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
