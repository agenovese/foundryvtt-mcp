After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br/><br/><strong>Languages</strong>: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.
