Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.\nThe portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.\nAny creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "Player's Handbook", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "action", "value": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "10", "units": "minute"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "500", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 6, "school": "con", "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["vocal", "somatic", "concentration"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "arcane-gate", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}]
