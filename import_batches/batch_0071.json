A tiefling\n        (pronounced\n        TEE-fling) is linked by blood to a devil, a demon, or some other Fiend.

Others possess the unearthly beauty of a succubus, or they\n            have\n            physical features in common with a night hag, a yugoloth, or some other <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Rules%20Definitions?expansion=32231#Alignment\" target=\"_blank\">Neutral Evil</a> fiendish ancestor.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Infernal</h3>\n<p>The infernal legacy connects tieflings not only to Gehenna but also the Nine Hells and the raging\n            battlefields of\n            Acheron. Horns, spines, tails, golden eyes, and a faint odor of sulfur or smoke are common physical features\n            of such\n            tieflings, most of whom trace their ancestry to devils.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Tiefling Traits</h3>\n<p>As a Tiefling, you have the following special traits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.\u00a0</strong></em>You have <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Rules%20Definitions?expansion=32231#Darkvision\" target=\"_blank\">Darkvision</a> with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fiendish Legacy.</strong></em>\u00a0You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you\n            supernatural\n            abilities.
