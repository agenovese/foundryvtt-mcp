If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.\r</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "Tasha's Cauldron of Everything", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "action", "value": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "1", "units": "hour"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "90", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 5, "school": "con", "materials": {"value": "a golden reliquary worth at least 500 gp", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["vocal", "somatic", "material", "concentration"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "summon-celestial", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}]
