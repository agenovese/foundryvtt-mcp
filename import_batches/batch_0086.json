If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.\r\nTo cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.\r\nThe spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with none of you being transported.\r</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "Tasha's Cauldron of Everything", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "minute", "value": 10, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "6", "units": "hour"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "20", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 7, "school": "con", "materials": {"value": "a magic item or a willing creature from the destination world", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["vocal", "somatic", "material"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "dream-of-the-blue-veil", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}]
