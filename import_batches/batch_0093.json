Any objects in that space becomes encased.\n\nA creature caught within the 40 ft. cube must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly encased in diamond. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to begin encased and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming fully encased on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The diamond prison remains even after the spell has ended.\n\nThe diamond encasing can be destroyed, however a shatter spell is too weak to affect it; a disintegrate spell, or a +2 magical weapon or higher is needed to do any damage to it. Each 5 foot by 5 foot cube has an AC of 26 and 25 hit points before it shatters into irregular shards of now worthless diamond.</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "Tavern Tales Vol 1 - A Trip Away Inn", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "action", "value": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "1", "units": "minute"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "40", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 9, "school": "trs", "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["concentration"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "diamond-wall", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}, {"name": "Time Reverse", "type": "spell", "img": "icons/magic/control/buff-flight-wings-runes-purple.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>Time Reverse\n\n(9th level Transmutation)\n\nCasting Time: Reaction\n\nRange: 60 ft.\n\nComponents: V (retrorsum converti), M (A diamond worth 1,000 gp, a pinch of sand)\n\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nClass: Wizard\n\nReciting this spell will turn back time exactly six seconds, enough time to correct a single mistake.
