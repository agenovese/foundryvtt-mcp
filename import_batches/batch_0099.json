A hag will cast this spell on two of her minions or slaves who must be restrained, willing, or otherwise forced to keep within five feet of the sacrifice during the duration of the casting of aberrate. A hag will sometimes cast this on a captive as a form of punishment or short-term curse, as was seen in the story of Prince Vilhelm \u201cDrippy\u201d whose womanizing and carousing convinced his third wife to make a deal with the hag Broomhill; she captured Vilhelm and turned him into a grotesque mix of human and boar for a day. When this spell is cast, two creatures no larger than Medium in size merge together to create a grotesque creature as hideous as it is violent and deadly. An example of a bugbear and ettercap transformed into a grotesque can be found in the bestiary. Any two Medium sized creatures can be turned into a grotesque by using the spell aberrate. Note: To create your own grotesque, choose the more powerful creature as the base creature, then combine their Str and Con bonus modifiers into a new ability (Str 15 and Str 13 have the bonuses +2 and +1. When combined you need a stat that gives a +3: either Str 16 or Str 17). Combine Con the same way and use the worst ability choice for Dex, Int, Wis, and Chr. Then take creative license with the rest. The combined creature should be +1 CR of whichever creature was strongest. The grotesque in the bestiary was created using these guidelines.</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "The Complete Hag", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "minute", "value": 3, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "24", "units": "hour"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "15", "units": "ft"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 2, "school": "trs", "materials": {"value": "large pregnant herbivore, such as a cow, horse, or ox, which is ritually killed", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["vocal", "somatic", "material"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "aberrate", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}, {"name": "Brightburn", "type": "spell", "img": "icons/magic/fire/projectile-fireball-smoke-strong-orange.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>This spell will only work if the target is illuminated by moonlight.
