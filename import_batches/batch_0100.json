While doing this she can be attacked from either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. After she casts the spell she thrusts the spoon into the dreamer\u2019s head. The dreamer will make a Charisma saving throw. Upon failure, the dreamer will take 7 (2d6) psychic damage each round that the hag is concentrating, up to a minute. The hag regains hit points equal to half the damage inflicted. The hag can gain up to 10 temporary hit points if she is fully healed. These hit points will be removed after an hour. If the dreamer makes its Charisma saving throw, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage but immediately wakes up with a pounding headache. The hag will be pushed back fully into the Ethereal Plane and paralyzed until the start of her next turn. Any dreamer that makes their saving throw is immune to dream eater for a week.
