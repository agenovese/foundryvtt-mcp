Hags use this cantrip to create moonlight for some of their spells and rituals need natural moonlight in order to work. A hag could also use this cantrip to illuminate herself in sunlight if this spell is cast during the day. This spell will part nonmagical clouds or thick smoke within sight of the caster. The caster can pierce a large enough hole in the clouds or fog to reveal the sun, moon, or stars to those on the ground who are within 100 hundred feet of the caster. This spell can also move up to 100 cubic feet of nonmagical cloud, fog, or smoke a maximum of 60 feet. If this spell is cast on a creature mostly made of air, clouds, fog, or mist, then the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be moved 10 feet away from the caster. A creature, moved in this way is immune to part clouds for 24 hours. This spell moves a susceptible creature further when you reach 5th level (20 feet), 7th level (30 feet), 9th level (40 feet), and 11th level (50 feet).</p>", "chat": ""}, "source": {"custom": "", "book": "The Complete Hag", "page": "", "license": "", "rules": "2014", "revision": 1}, "activation": {"type": "action", "value": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "", "units": "inst"}, "target": {"affects": {"type": "", "count": "", "choice": false}, "template": {"size": "", "units": "ft", "type": "", "contiguous": false}}, "range": {"value": "", "units": "spec"}, "uses": {"max": "", "recovery": [], "spent": 0}, "level": 0, "school": "trs", "materials": {"value": "thick smoke from any source and a dagger or other blade", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "properties": ["vocal", "somatic", "material"], "activities": {}, "identifier": "part-clouds", "method": "spell", "prepared": 0}}, {"name": "Raven in Moonlight", "type": "spell", "img": "icons/magic/perception/eye-ringed-glow-angry-small-teal.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>A hag that uses this cantrip can see terrain and Huge sized creatures, as if viewed from above, within five hundred feet, but only if the moon is visible to the hag.
